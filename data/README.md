The data values in this folder have been extracted from the SDE on EVE Online.

The files were created by using the .xls/.csv dumps, opening them in a spreadsheet application and apply display formatting on the columns so that a simple copy/paste ends up in a Go array.
Only the necessary columns have been taken, the files are big enough as they are.

All of this is a manual process; The map layout seldom changes and automating this process would take more effort.

Credits for the dumps go to the person behind "Steve Ronuken", who provides the extracts in various forms:
